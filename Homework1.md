## Homework 1: The plotting of Liberia's administrative boundaries

For my homework assignment, I was able to obtain the spatial data that describes Liberia's administrative boundaries and plot the geospatial data. In order to produce a series of plots with each one being more and more in-depth and advanced to the next level of administration, I had to create 4 different objects. These objects were : lbr_int, lbr_adm1, lbr_adm2, and lbr_adm3. For example, lbr_int object only stores the files from GADM required to plot the international boundary of Liberia. However, lbr_adm3 stores the files required to plot the third adminsitrative subdivisions within Liberia. To plot, I used functions from a package called ggplot(). I was able to play around with fill colors, line colors, text font, and other aspects to make the maps more aesthetically pleasing. Below are my 3 plots and a snippet of the script used to produce them.

From the last plot, It's clear that I could have done a better job at the sizing of the text. However, my laptop was experiecing issues with the large amount of data that had just been downloaded and all the applications running.
