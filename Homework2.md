## Extracting populations from a Raster and Aggregating to each Unit

In this assignment, I selected to produce the geospatial data plots of the LMIC, Lesotho. Lesotho is a land-locked country, located in Southern Africa. Lesotho's capital is Maseru, and its 2019 population is 2,125,268 persons. I began by downloading Lesotho's 2019 population data from the World pop website. Throughout the assignment, I used the raster package in RStudio to create a raster layer. I was able to plot the first administrative level with the raster layer on top of it. At the end of the assignment, I was able to actually "add" this raster layer to my variable, lso_adm1, which had all the adminsitrative boundary information. I separated population counts based on their "ID", which just meant which administrative district. When I summed all the population counts, I got a total population of : 1,855,656. This value is definitly a little off, but still is close. Below are some fun pictures of some of the plots and dataframes I produced:
