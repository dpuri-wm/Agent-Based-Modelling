A) In order to obtain the DHS data, I submitted a request for access to the Ethiopia 2016 Households and Persons survey dataset. In my explanation, I stated that I intended to use the data to generate a synthetic population that I could use in my agent-based model. Furthermore, I needed the remotely sensed data to estimate dwelling locations and other features of the data.

   The DHS (Demographic and Health surveys) data is for Ethopia in 2016. In my source data, 16,500 households were sampled with 15,683 females surveyed and 12,688 males surveyed. The variables we were most interested in studying were: sex, age, education, and wealth. Something I found interesting when I was reading about the data was that men had a lower response rate than women, when it came to interviews. However, rural men had a higher response rate than men in urban locations. I pulled the age and sex of household members, region identifier (location), and sample weights. In general, this step was not too complicated as it just involved reading in the data, and finding the columns that corresponded to the variable I wanted to extract.
