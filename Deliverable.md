A) In order to obtain the DHS data, I submitted a request for access to the Ethiopia 2016 Households and Persons survey dataset. In my explanation, I stated that I intended to use the data to generate a synthetic population that I could use in my agent-based model. Furthermore, I needed the remotely sensed data to estimate dwelling locations and other features of the data.

   The DHS (Demographic and Health surveys) data is for Ethopia in 2016. In my source data, 16,500 households were sampled with 15,683 females surveyed and 12,688 males surveyed. The variables we were most interested in studying were: sex, age, education, and wealth. Something I found interesting when I was reading about the data was that men had a lower response rate than women, when it came to interviews. However, rural men had a higher response rate than men in urban locations. I pulled the age and sex of household members, region identifier (location), and sample weights. In general, this step was not too complicated as it just involved reading in the data, and finding the columns that corresponded to the variable I wanted to extract. 

B) After acquiring the data, I began spatially locating households among my location. I generated the household structure by assigning demographic attributes of persons, and calculated percent error. First and foremost, I do want to address the limitations of my computer. My 2012 macbook could not handle the population size and large amount of data at the adm 0 level. In fact, it even struggled at the adm1 level. Thus, I could only spatially locate households at the adm2 level. I chose Afar Regional state, an adm 2 region, to focus on. The population of Afar is roughly 1.8 million people, and I was especially interested in choosing my location since in project 1, I studied Eritrea. The region of Afar is the location of regional instability between Ethiopia and Eritrea. To begin assigning household locations, I first extracted the population density from a 2016 population raster of Ethiopia. Next, I used the spatstat::rpoint() command, and found hhs_pts and hhs_locs. After finding my household locations for Afar, I calculated the percent error to be ~ 4.83 %.
