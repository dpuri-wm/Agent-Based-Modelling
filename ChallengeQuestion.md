In this assignment, I created a plot on RStudio with 50 randomly placed dwelling uits, 40 small trees (represented by the small, bright green circles), and 12 large trees (represented by the large green/beige circles). Next, I randomly selected 7 homes from the 50, and used a dash line to represent a person's path between the homes! Below is my plot and the script I used to produce it.
