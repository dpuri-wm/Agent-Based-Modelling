"Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement (Sinan Aral, 2014)." This powerful statement alone encaptures the imperative need for data, and the inter-disciplinary field of data science that uncovers important insights and trends from the data. In our rapidly-evolving, modern world, data science and its use in agent-based modelling is the tool that will drive human development. For simplicity, human beings have often viewed our world in cause-effect relationships. Additionally, its easier to only consider relationships between two things: two people, two organizations, two countries, etc. However, it has become ever more apparent that our world cannot be viewed in such a manner - it requires a much more dynamic analysis. The emerging idea of complex, economic, adaptive systems challenge simple cause-effect assumptions, and views the world by the various interactions and relationships of its components. The agents within a complex, economic, adaptive system not only affect many other components, but are affected by the entire system themselves. The idea of adaptive systems can be perplexing, but agent-based modelling can help to advance our understanding of these systems. With everything going on in the world today amidst the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic, and as a pre-health student, I would like to discuss how agent-based modelling can benefit human development, through a public health lens.
