"Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement (Sinan Aral, 2014)." This powerful statement alone encaptures the imperative need for data, and the inter-disciplinary field of data science that uncovers important insights and trends from the data. In our rapidly-evolving, modern world, data science and its use in agent-based modelling is the tool that will drive human development. For simplicity, human beings have often viewed our world in cause-effect relationships. Additionally, its easier to only consider relationships between two things: two people, two organizations, two countries, etc. However, it has become ever more apparent that our world cannot be viewed in such a manner - it requires a much more dynamic analysis. The emerging idea of complex, economic, adaptive systems challenge simple cause-effect assumptions, and views the world by the various interactions and relationships of its components. The agents within a complex, economic, adaptive system not only affect many other components, but are affected by the entire system themselves. The idea of adaptive systems can be perplexing, but agent-based modelling can help to advance our understanding of these systems. With everything going on in the world today amidst the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic, and as a pre-health student, I would like to discuss how agent-based modelling can benefit human development, through a public health lens.

Currently, the Covid-19 pandemic is taking a terrible toll on the world. In the United States, there has been much debate about a potential mask mandate, whether restaurants/bars should be open, if public schools should offer in-person classes, etc. With more relaxed measures, the infection rate could increase. Another issue to consider is the intensive care unit bed occupancy, and whether hospitals are capable of treating the large increase in patients. If ICUs are overwhelmed, we may have to go into another lockdown. As you can see, there is a delicate balance, a sort of homeostasis, that must be reached within this huge complex, economic, adaptive system. There are so many agents at play, from uber drivers, teachers, and government policy makers, to healthcare organizations and companies.An agent based model is able to simulate interactions between autonomous agents and assess their impact on the system as a whole. Luckily, agent based models have been utilized in discussing policy.
