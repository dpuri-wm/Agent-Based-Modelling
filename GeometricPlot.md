## Assignment
In this exercise, I created a geometric bar plot of Lesotho's population, and a spatial plot that displayed population across districts, with annotations of population density included! I utilized the simple feature object that I created last time, labelled lso_adm1 and added 2 new columns to it, area and density. Overall, I thought this script was a bit more challenging to run and I ran into some issues that I still need to resolve.
