In this exercise, I created a geometric bar plot of Lesotho's population! I used the simple feature object I created last time, lso_adm1. I also produced a spatial plot with a fill = pop19, and included the population density on the plot. Some key commands and features I used included: adding 2 new columns to lso_adm1 (an area column and a density column), using coord_flip() to flip the x and y axis, using nudge_y to move around text on my spatial plot so they are not overlapping and unable to be read, and more!
