## Assignment
In this exercise, I created a geometric bar plot of Lesotho's population, and a spatial plot that displayed population across districts, with annotations of population density included! I utilized the simple feature object that I created last time, labelled lso_adm1 and added 2 new columns to it, area and density. Overall, I thought this script was a bit more challenging to run and I ran into some issues that I still need to resolve.

Next, I chose one district to zoom in on. I decide to choose Berea, and wanted to view population across the district. I thought this would be an interesting choice since Masseru is the capital, and thus, it would be cool to see if people were located closer to the border of Berea and Masseru. My predictions were not all that correct. Population is clumped in the lower left of the plot, with some "spikes" in the upper region of the district.
