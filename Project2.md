### Afar, Ethiopia

Afar Regional State is a region in my adm_1 that I decided to zoom in on! It has a population of ~ 1.8 million persons. This region has been the location of major instability due to the Ethiopian - Eritrean war of 1998-2000. The area is heaily agricultural. Below shows the population:

### Addis Abeba, Ethiopia

Due to some laptop constraints and other plotting issues, I was only able to plot the households across the Addis Abeba region. Addis Abeba is the captial of Ethiopia, and below is my planar point pattern:

I have also included the population plot:

Originally, I had intended to work with Addis Abeba, but the population size was too large, and my latop was not able to generate households from the adm1 data, when I had filtered it to Addis Abeba.
